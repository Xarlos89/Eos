# Eos
A Discord.py bot, utilizing docker.

Discord.py bot  **<->**  Flask API  **<->**  Postgres DB

---
# Installation
To run this bot, first install Docker.
Then:
1. Copy the example env file `cd src/ && cp .env.EXAMPLE .env`
2. Replace "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with your Discord Bot token and MASTER_GUILD with the ID of the main guild that your bot will be active in.
3. `docker compose up -d`
4. The bot should come online. You can use the `>hc` command to run a healthcheck on the system.

If you already have postgres installed on your system then you may have conflicting ports, in that case change the `POSTGRES_PORT` to a free port in the `.env`, usually `5433`. Then rebuild by using following command:
```
docker compose up -d --build
```

# Contributing
Some short guidelines and points on contributing to Eos.
- All changes must come via PR to master, this requires 1 approval.
- I recommend sticking with `feature/some-feature`, `bugfix/some-bug`, `chore/some-chore` for branch names.
- BEFORE you commit, you can stage changes with `git add <file>` and then run checks via `pre-commit` (https://pre-commit.com)

# Infrastructure
### Postgres Database
- Currently using Postgres 17.5
- The default port is defined in your `.env`

Postgres data is stored in a named Docker volume (`postgres-data`). Do not remove it if you want the data to persist.

To reset the database, remove the volume:
```
docker compose down -v
```

The init script at `src/db/init.sql` runs on the initial startup.

A migration service (`Dockerfile-migration`) runs automatically before the API starts on every `docker compose up`, applying any changes in `src/db/migrations.sql`.

### Flask API
The Flask API is located at `src/api/`. It runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` unless you've changed the Flask settings in `.env`.

The functions that connect the API to the database are at `src/api/core/db_helper.py` and serve as an abstraction over the psycopg functions.

A `.postman` directory is included, which contains a postman collection if you feel like messing about with the API locally in postman. 

### Discord.py Bot
The Bot is running using Discord.py with cog-based commands.
- While not recommended, you may also run the bot manually for debugging using `python main.py` if your token is in the `.env`, however the bot depends on the API being reachable.

Cogs are located at `src/bot/cogs/` and are separated by their purpose: `admin/`, `features/`, `logging/`, `moderation/`, `verification/`.

The functions that connect the bot to the API are at `src/bot/core/api_helper.py` and serve as an abstraction over the HTTP requests happening in the background.

# Commands

Commands use one of two invocation styles:
- **`>`** — prefix commands (e.g. `>hc`). Some also work as slash commands if you run `>sync` first.
- **`/`** — slash-only commands, registered via Discord's application command system.

Permission levels referenced below:
- **Admin** — requires Discord administrator permission
- **Moderator** — requires the ban_members Discord permission
- **Master guild only** — command only runs in the guild set as `MASTER_GUILD`
